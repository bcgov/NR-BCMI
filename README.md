## Introduction

The Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI), Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy (ENV), and Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) have collaborated to make information on the Provinceâ€™s oversight of major mines in British Columbia accessible.

The application is being developed as an open source solution.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Git commit signing is required for commits. [How to setup git commit signing](https://sabbour.me/setting-up-signed-git-commits-on-macos/)

**Software Requirements**

- Node 20 must be used.
- @angular/cli should be installed.
- Docker should be installed.

### Installation

- [Clone the nr-bcmi repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

**To run/develop using docker:**
1. Set the KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET env in docker-compose
1. Run ```docker compose up ```

**To run the frontend locally:**
  1. Install angular/cli ```npm i -g @angular/cli```
  1. ``` cd bcmi ```
  1. ``` npm install ```
  1. ``` npm run start ```

  **To run Strapi locally:**
  1. create an .env file in the cms folder using the .env.template, find secrets in openshift
  1. ``` cd cms ```
  1. ``` npm install ```
  1. ``` npm run develop ```
  1. Login to strapi admin at http://localhost:1337/admin
  1. See graphql queries at http://localhost:1337/graphql (ensure the strappi content has the 'find' role enabled)

## Running tests:

### Unit tests

Set up via [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest).
1. Run ```npm test``` to execute the unit tests.

### End-to-end functional tests

Set up with [BDDStack](https://github.com/BCDevOps/BDDStack) and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). Modify `GebConfig.groovy` to customise your preferred browser. Configured remotes, confirmed to work with current tests include Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Internet explorer and Safari are available as well, but tests fail due to driver compatiblity with current tests.

### BrowserStack Config

Open Source projects have free access to Browserstack Live and Automate, for up to 5 team members. To run tests with Browserstack you need to set the following environemnt variables:

1. BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME
1. BROWSERSTACK_TOKEN
1. DEBUG_MODE (true or false)

#### Run tests against local application:

- Run `ng run e2e` to automatically start the application locally and execute the end-to-end tests against a headless Chrome.

    OR

- Download BrowserStack [binary](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing) set `BASEURL` to your local application address, and run `./gradlew remoteChrome`

Note, e2e functional testing requires Java 10+.

#### Run tests against remote application:

1. Determine the URL at which the application is running.
1. Update the baseurl to the URL from step 1:
    - Either modify the GebConfig.groovy baseUrl directly.
    - Or set a `BASEURL` environment variable
1. See `functional-tests/readme.md` for how to execute the tests.

See the [BDDStack Wiki](https://github.com/BCDevOps/BDDStack/wiki) for more information.

## Architecture

BCMI is built using TypeScript and Angular for the front end, with Jest for testing. It employs PostgreSQL for database management and Node.js for the server, alongside Bootstrap and jQuery for design and interactivity. Apollo & GraphQL facilitates data querying, while Strapi acts as the headless CMS.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Deployment

BCMI uses the [quickstart openshift template](https://github.com/bcgov/quickstart-openshift) and is deployed using github actions and helm charts found in the `.github/workflows` and `charts` folders.

When a PR is opened unique pr deployment is deployed to the dev environment. Once the dev is satisfied with the PR and it is merged the changes are automatically deployed to the test environment for user testing. Once ready the changes can be deployed to production by manually triggering the `Deploy to production` workflow.
